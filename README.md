V2 Prototype Code
Not for production use -- end user assumes responsibility for usage and testing of this code

This code is part of a Mechanical Senior Design Project for Johns Hopkins University, sponsored by In-Q-Tel Labs.
IQT Labs is a branch of the IQT venture capital firm, supporting emerging technologies that may be useful to the United States.

This project is part of an effort to understand the concept of maritime domain awarness. The code attached is designed to operate an autonomous vessel.
Electrical schematics and a user manual are included in the documentation.

The scope of this code project is to provide the foundations of a platform that can:
1. Operate unsupervised, in open water, for an undetermined amount of time
2. Be controlled remotely, anywhere in the world, using the Iridium Satellite network
3. (Electrically) support a payload 
4. Support up to 8 onboard sensors with an analog voltage output of 0-3.3V
5. Be adapted to operate on other physical platforms (relatively) easily


Performance is not guaranteed. Known issues have been addressed the in the code comments. Use responsibly. 

Libraries likley need to be moved into /Arduino/libraries folder on local machine before compling can be done using Arduino IDE.
